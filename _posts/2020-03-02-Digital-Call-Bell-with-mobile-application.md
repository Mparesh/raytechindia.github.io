Call bell system is a simple yet effective solution to remotely alert an attendant. This product   package includes a set of remote controllers and an indicator receiver.

The receiver has indicators and a buzzer inbuilt. Pressing the remote will glow indicator light for the corresponding number and the attendant can rush to the calling party. The buzzer will not stop unless the calling party turns it off. This setup improves overall efficiency of the complete system.


This setup is now available through a mobile application. Calling party can use the app instead of remotes to call attendants. Offices and hospitals can benefit from this setup.
